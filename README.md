## Install Locally the project 

If you want to install the project you **must have docker install** on your computer. Check [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) documentation for more informations.

You also need to ask for the .**env file** \(this file must no be in the git repo\) .

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
